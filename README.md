# MMM-RainRadarDWD
This module has been developed mostly by vibe coding with an AI as I am not a real developer. If you want to take over the module and maintaine the code, please feel free to contact me. I just wanted to get a solution for myself and happy to share the result for now =)

A smart Rain & Snow Radar module for [MagicMirror²]([https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror]) using data from GERMAN weather service (DWD). Hence it is only working for areas in Germany!

It displays animated radar data (past and forecast) from the official **Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)** on an OpenLayers map. 

To keep your mirror clean, the module acts smartly: It stays completely hidden during sunny weather and only pops up if rain, snow, sleet, or hail is expected at your location within your configured timeframe.

## Features
* **Smart Visibility:** Only shows up when precipitation is coming.
* **Precipitation Detection:** Automatically detects and displays whether to expect rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
* **Official Data:** Uses DWD WMS `dwd:Niederschlagsradar` for up to 2 hours of past measurements and 2 hours of future forecasting (Nowcast).

## Configuration

Add the module to your config/config.js file. All parameters are optional and will fall back to defaults if omitted. There are quite a number of configuration options available, but you only need to configure lat and lon for your location to make the module work!

Basic configuration:
```
{
    module: "MMM-RainRadarDWD",
    position: "top_right",
    config: {
        lat: 53.5511,
        lon: 9.9937,
    }
},
```

Configuration with all parameters and short explanation (see also table below)
```
{
    module: "MMM-RainRadarDWD",
    position: "top_right",
    config: {
        lat: 53.5511,                  // Latitude (e.g., Hamburg)

        // --- Visibility & Logic ---
        alwaysVisible: false,          // TRUE: map is always there. FALSE: pops up only if rain/snow is coming.
        showIfRainWithin: 120,         // Timeframe (minutes) to check for upcoming precipitation.
        
        // --- Time Frames (DWD Limits: max 120 past, max 120 future) ---
        timePast: 60,                  // How many minutes into the past to animate?

        zoomLevel: 9,                  // Map Zoom (9-10 recommended for region view)
        cloudBlur: 12,                  // Softens radar pixels (0 = sharp grid, 2-5 = realistic clouds)
        markerSymbol: "fa-home",       // FontAwesome icon for your location
        markerColor: "#ff0000",        // Color of the center marker

## Configuration Options Explained

## Configuration Options

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lat` | Number | `53.5511` | Latitude of your location. |
| `lon` | Number | `9.9937` | Longitude of your location. |
| `alwaysVisible` | Boolean | `false` | If `true`, the map is always shown. If `false`, it acts smartly and only shows up when precipitation is detected. |
| `showIfRainWithin`| Number | `120` | If `alwaysVisible` is `false`, the module will check if precipitation is expected within this amount of minutes. |
| `rainSearchRadius`| Number | `0` | Radius in km. Performs a cross-scan (Center, North, South, East, West) to detect precipitation passing slightly off-center. `0` checks exact location only. 1-5 will check for corresponding km in each direction  |
| `timePast` | Number | `60` | How many minutes into the past the radar should show. Max: 120. |
| `timeFuture` | Number | `120` | How many minutes into the future the forecast should show. Max: 120. |
| `frameStep` | Number | `10` | The minute increments between frames. Default is 10. Minimum is 5. |
| `animationSpeed`| Number | `2000` | Milliseconds per frame. `2000` is highly recommended to allow the CSS cross-fade animation to look smooth. |
| `width` | String | `"350px"` | Width of the module container. |
| `height` | String | `"350px"` | Height of the module container. |
| `border` | String | `"none"` | CSS border property (e.g., `"2px solid #fff"`). |
| `zoomLevel` | Number | `9` | Initial map zoom. (9-10 recommended for regional view). |
| `cloudBlur` | Number | `2` | CSS blur applied to the radar layer. `0` shows the raw grid. `2` to `5` creates realistic, soft clouds. |
| `markerSymbol` | String | `"fa-home"` | FontAwesome icon name for the center location marker. |
| `markerColor` | String | `"#ff0000"`| Color of the center location marker. |
| `showLegend` | Boolean | `true` | Show the custom CSS color scale. |
| `legendPosition`| String | `"bottom"`| Position of the legend. Options: `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, `"right"`. |
| `textPast` | String | `"PAST"` | Label used for past radar frames. |
| `textNow` | String | `"NOW"` | Label used for the current time frame. |

| `textRainExpected`| String | `" - Rain expected:"`| Text appended when rain is detected. |
| `textSnowExpected`| String | `" - Snow expected:"`| Text appended when snow is detected. |
| `textSleetExpected`| String| `" - Sleet expected:"`| Text appended when sleet is detected. |
| `textHailExpected`| String | `" - Hail expected:"`| Text appended when hail is detected. |
| `textLoading` | String | `"Loading data..."`| Initial text shown while fetching DWD data. |
| `textLight` | String | `"Light"` | Text for the lowest value on the legend. |
| `textHeavy` | String | `"Heavy"` | Text for the highest value on the legend. |
| `logLevel` | String | `"INFO"` | Terminal output verbosity. Choose `"NONE"`, `"ERROR"`, `"INFO"`, or `"DEBUG"`. |
## Zoom Levels Reference

OpenLayers uses a logarithmic scale for zoom levels. Depending on your preference, set zoomLevel to:
    4 - 6: Country level (e.g., all of Germany).
    7 - 8: State level (Good to see incoming fronts from afar).
    9 - 10: Regional level (Best balance between overview and detail. Recommended).
    11 - 13: City/District level (You can see parts of your city).
    14+: Street level (Not recommended, as radar pixels will become too large).
